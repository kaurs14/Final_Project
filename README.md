# Final_Project
I developed N-body integrator for the two body problem/Planetary system code as my final project for the computational astrophysics course.

# Running Simulation
The user can run the simulation by using the following code;
`python3 nbody.py`
The user can specify the mass, position and velocity of the Sun and Earth in the `initial_conditions` function in `setup.py`. The user can specify the final time, time step, frame rate and the integrator in `nbody.py`. The integrator can be `euler` and `rk4`.
